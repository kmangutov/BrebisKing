Settlers of Catan Clone - Frontend PRD
1. Overview
We are building a Settlers of Catan clone using Three.js with a top-down perspective. The game features a hexagonal board, resource generation based on dice rolls, and mechanics for building roads, cities, and upgrading cities into hotels.

The initial implementation will be single-player, with a turn-based system where the player rolls dice, collects resources, and builds structures.

2. Core Gameplay Features (MVP)
2.1 Board & Tiles
The board consists of 19 hexagonal tiles, each assigned a number from 1 to 12.
Tile types include:
Rock
Sheep
Trees (Wood)
Bricks
Stone
Wheat
Tiles generate resources when their assigned number is rolled.
2.2 Turn-Based Mechanics
Each turn:
The player rolls 2 dice (values between 2-12).
Tiles matching the rolled number generate resources for the player.
The player spends resources to build or upgrade structures.
2.3 Building Mechanics
Roads: Placed on the borders between hex tiles. (costs 1 brick and 1 wood)
Cities: Placed on hex tiles, allow resource collection. (costs 1 bricks, 1 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat)
Hotels (City Upgrades): Doubles the resources earned when the tile number is rolled. (costs 3 wheat and 2 stone)
3. User Interface (UI)
Top-down Three.js board visualization.
Dice roll animation for visual feedback.
Clickable UI for building selection (e.g., buttons for placing roads, cities, upgrading to hotels).
Resource counter (displaying available resources).
End turn button.
4. Frontend Technical Scope
Three.js for 3D rendering of the board, roads, and structures.
State management to track board state, resources, and player actions.
Event system for dice rolling, resource distribution, and building placement.
UI layer (canvas-based HUD or HTML overlay) for displaying resources and controls.
